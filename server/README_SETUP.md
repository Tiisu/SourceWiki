## 🔄 Next Steps
Your server is now fully functional and ready to replace the mock data in your React client. You can:

1. **Update client API calls** to use `http://localhost:3001/api`
2. **Implement authentication** in React components
3. **Connect submission forms** to the real API
4. **Update admin dashboard** to use live data
5. **Add file upload** to the submission form

The MongoDB database is populated and the server is running on port 3001!
